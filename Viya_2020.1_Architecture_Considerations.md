## Document Information

## Summary of Key Architecture Considerations

* New release of Viya
  * The last release of Viya 3.X is Viya 3.5
  * The following release is called **SAS Viya 4** or simple **SAS Viya** and should be ready on `insert date here`.
* Update cadence
  * There will 2 cadences of updates:
  * Monthly (called Stable)
  * bi-yearly (called LTS)
* Deployment Technology
  * Starting with Viya 2020.1, all Viya software is delivered as Container Images
  * Viya 2020 requires a Kubernetes Cluster to run
  * Viya is deployed on Kubernetes by applying a manifest file
  * The manifest file is generated from templates provided by SAS for the core functionality, and site-specific customizations
* Support
  * In the first release (2020.1), only Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is supported
  * More Kubernetes will be supported in the future
  * SAS does NOT provide support for Installing or Administering Kubernetes itself
* Hosted Options
  * Customers can choose to have their Viya 2020 environment hosted on SAS Cloud
  * Customers can also choose to use SAS Remote Managed Services (on AKS only with Viya 2020.1)
* Feature Parity
  * Viya 2020.1 should be at feature parity with Viya 3.5
* Non-Functional Aspects
  * HA: some support for HA
  * Scalability: some support for scalability
  * Encryption:
  * Authentication:

## Platform Architecture

### SAS Software Topology

#### Dynamic Software Topology

* Kubernetes changes the paradigm of Software Topology
* Each part of the environment is liable to stop on one machine and restart on another
* No part of the software is "stuck" on any given machine
* Many parts of the software can be scaled out
* Any part of the software that dies prematurely should be automatically restarted by Kubernetes

#### Deployment Technology

* Container Images
* Manifest Files
* Kubernetes
* Kustomize

#### Software Components

* Stateful
  * Consul
  * Posgtres
* Stateless
  * MicroServices
  * Web Applications
* Analytics Engines
  * SPRE
  * CAS

#### Multi-Tenancy

* Viya 2020.1 only supports Namespace-based Multi-Tenancy
* Each tenant has to be deployed in a distinct Kubernetes Namespace

#### Deployment Scenarios

#### SAS Client Interface for Viya

* Web Browsers
* APIs
* Programming Languages

### Hardware & OS Architecture

#### Hardware Requirements

* Servers (total cores + mem as spare capacity)

#### Operating System Requirements

* Linux x64
* Docker version
* Kubernetes Version

#### Additional Software

* Monitoring
* logging
* TLS certs (cert-manager)
* CLIs?

#### Hardware Scalability

* Node auto-scaling on Cloud Providers. Are we compatible with it?

### Sizing

* Sizing needs a new paradigm
  * What if customer is building a cluster just for Viya?
  * What if Viya has to live in an existing (potentially busy) Kubernetes?

### Storage Architecture

#### Ephemeral Storage

* Ephemeral Storage in Kubernetes
* SASWork
* CAS Disk Cache

#### Persistent Storage

* Persistent Storage on Kubernetes (storageclasses)
* Block Storage
* Shared FS
* RWO vs RWX

#### Parallel Data I/O

#### Shared File Systems

#### Hadoop Requirements

#### Object Storage

* AWS S3 (support, etc..)

### Availability

### Scalability

### Elasticity

* not out of the box
* can use HPA (H? Pod Autoscaler) on stateless pieces

### Performance

* no specific info yet

## System Management

### Configuration Management

* Part of it in `kustomization.yaml` and `./site-config/`
* Part of it should be in EVM, saved in Consul

### Disaster Recovery

### Backup & Restore

### Scheduling

* No built-in support for scheduling
* Possible using Kubernetes resources

### System Management & Monitoring

* Environment Manager no longer monitors performance and logs
* Replaced with integration into external tools (Prometheus/Grafana/EFK/ELK)

### Migration from Viya 3.X

* Can migrate from Viya 3.5
* Can migrate from Viya 3.4?
* Can NOT migrate from SAS 9.X?

### Security

#### Authentication

* LDAP requirements
* SCIM

#### Authorization

#### Encryption

* no Kerberos

## Infrastructure

### Virtualization

* Abstracted out: Nodes can be physical or Virtual

### Grid Computing

* Not available on Viya 2020.1
* Should be available later
